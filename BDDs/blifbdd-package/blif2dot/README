Usage: blif2dot -option ckt_name.blif.

File created: ckt_name.blif2dot.dot

Option: There is only one option. -sepPI.

        Under default, all PIs which share the same name are bounded
	together.

	By turning on -sepPI, all PIs are separated. PIs which share
	the same names are duplicated. This option will generate
	nice dot drawing.
